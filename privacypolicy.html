            <h2>Privacy Policy - the basics</h2>
            
            <p>Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all of the ways a website collects, uses, discloses, processes, and manages the data of its visitors and customers. It usually also includes a statement regarding the website's commitment to protecting its visitors' or customers' privacy, and an explanation about the different mechanisms the website is implementing in order to protect privacy.</p>
            
            <p>Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations of what must be included in a Privacy Policy. You are responsible to make sure you are following the relevant legislation to your activities and location.</p>

            <h3>What to include in the Privacy Policy</h3>
            
            <p>Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of issues: the types of information the website is collecting and the manner in which it collects the data; an explanation about why is the website collecting these types of information; what are the website's practices on sharing the information with third parties; ways in which your visitors and customers can exercise their rights according to the relevant privacy legislation; the specific practices regarding minors' data collection; and much, much more.</p>
